# Unblocked Games website

## Description:
Another unblocked games website. Though this one looks like it was copied straight from tag-2, I hand coded the styles and files (I only took the games from other websites). I sometimes change the address and name to counter getting blocked by Cisco.

## Website features:
* Redirects to Google drive after 200 seconds ðŸ•™
* (soon to be public) Search tab ðŸ”Ž
* Fulscreen for games â‡±
* Favicon and title desgised as canvas dashboard ðŸ¤«
* Includes banger games like **Super Mario 64**, **Super Hot** and **Drift Hunters** ðŸ¤˜
* Ad free games for ever (I know, i'm so nice.) ðŸš«
* Quick Switch for redirecting to Google Drive manually (by pressing 'q' on the home page) âš¡
